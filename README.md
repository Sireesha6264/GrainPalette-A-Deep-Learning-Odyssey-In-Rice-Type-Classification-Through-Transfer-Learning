# GrainPalette: A Deep Learning Odyssey in Rice Type Classification through Transfer Learning

## Project Summary
GrainPalette leverages deep learning architectures and image-based analysis to identify and classify different rice varieties. Using transfer learning techniques, the system is built to extract fine-grained features from grain images and deliver high-confidence predictions, improving efficiency in agricultural diagnostics and grain quality control.

##  Technologies Used
- Python (Flask backend)
- TensorFlow / Keras (for model training)
- Transfer Learning (pre-trained CNNs)
- HTML/CSS & JS for front-end UI
- PHP (contact forms)
- Git & GitHub for version control

## Setup & Usage

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sireesha6264/GrainPalette-A-Deep-Learning-Odyssey-In-Rice-Type-Classification-Through-Transfer-Learning.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the Project:
   ```bash
   cd GrainPalette-A-Deep-Learning-Odyssey-In-Rice-Type-Classification-Through-Transfer-Learning
   ```
3. Setup your environment and dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Flask App
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
## Demo
